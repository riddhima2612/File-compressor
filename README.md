# File-compressor
File Compressor using Huffman Algorithm
A file compression tool implemented using the Huffman coding algorithm to reduce file sizes efficiently. This project demonstrates the application of lossless data compression techniques by encoding files with optimal prefix codes.

Key Features:

Compresses files using Huffman coding for reduced storage requirements
Decompresses files to restore original data without loss
Command-line interface for easy usage and integration
Supports multiple file types for compression


How It Works:

Analyzes the frequency of characters in the input file
Builds a binary tree to generate optimal prefix codes
Encodes the file using the generated Huffman codes
Decodes the compressed file to retrieve the original data
